## Overview <a name="overview"></a>

Ocean colors are derived from Ocean-tokens, which can be found in this
repository [here](https://github.com/ocean-ds/ocean-tokens).

### Primary <a name="primary"></a>

Blue is our main color and is used in most of our components.

<ColorRow type="primary" />

<br />

### Complementary <a name="complementary"></a>

Acqua is our supporting color that works together with blue. We use it, for example,
for buttons and links that need contrast on a blue background. It is also used in components
such as Radio Button, Checkbox and Toggle.

<ColorRow type="complementary" />

### Highlight <a name="highlight"></a>

We used coral as a strategic color to highlight certain elements. Its use is quite punctual
in the interfaces and freer in the illustrations.

<ColorRow type="highlight" />

<br />

### Interface <a name="interface"></a>

We use Interface Colors in titles, masses of text and secondary button states, for example.
In addition, we also use it as a background color to highlight any element that is on top of it.
For the latter case, we prefer lighter tones, such as Color Interface Light Up.

<ColorRow type="interface" />

### Status <a name="status"></a>

Status colors are used to visually reinforce the outcome of an action. Positive Status for success
messages and positive situations, Neutral Status for neutral or warning situations, such as a warning,
and Negative Status for errors or critical situations that require more user attention, such as cancel
buttons.

<ColorRow type="status" />
